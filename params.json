An LCD screen is wired to the boarduino; the Xbee RX pin is attached to the arduino's TX pin. On the bike wheel, a magnet is attached to a spoke. Nearby, a reed switch is stationary. The reed switch must be attached to either digital pin two or three to allow for an interrupt to be used.\r\n\r\nThe processing sketch reads serial data from an xbee and graphs it by drawing lines. The processing sketch saves the data and transforms incoming speed data into a graph. \r\n\r\nOn the bike, a magnetic reed switch senses a magnetic field; when a magnet passes by, it is triggered. The time in between revolutions is measured and converted into MPH. \r\n\r\n![A graph of incoming speed data. ](https://github.com/bobulisk/Bike-Cyclocomputer/blob/master/Pictures/processinggraph.png)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated in June-July, 2012 by Andrew M.
